      This project was built out of my affection for music.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Learning about subgenres increases appreciation of the art form, its culture and history.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Often times Ive met people who don't like a specific genre, but what they actually may not like, is the subgenre.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      My hope with this project, is to inspire others to explore and discover and use this as an opportunity to find music they may not hear otherwise,
      <br></br>
      as well as, use this as way to deepen conversations about music, which I love to have.
