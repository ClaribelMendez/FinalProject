              This project was built out of my affection for music.
            </p>
            <p>
              Learning about subgenres increases appreciation of the art form, its culture and history.
            </p>
            <p>
              Often times I've met people who don't like a specific genre, but what they actually may not like, is the subgenre.
            </p>
            <p>
              My hope with this project is to inspire others to explore and discover and use this as an opportunity to find music they may not hear otherwise,
              as well as, use this as way to deepen conversations about music, which I love to have.
            </p>
